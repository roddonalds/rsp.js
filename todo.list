// My intent is to create a dbus like api with node.js.
// I have the code API designed of Server and Client instances but I dont write the source code.
// I will provie you with 2 files.
// - first is socketServerInstance.js class from class DesktopSocket.Server();
// - second is socketClientInstance.js class from class DesktopSocket.Client()
// ... with maestry, abstract this into full and functional source code; 
// *** no need to cache the connections inside an array;
